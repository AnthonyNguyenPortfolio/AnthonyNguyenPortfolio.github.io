<hr> 

    <h2>The Mission</h2>

<p>Through tree advocacy, ReGreen focuses on care for flora, reforestation, and the mentoring of people of all ages. Who we collaborated with to create safer, greener neighborhoods:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Local businesses</li>
    <li>Governmental agencies</li>
    <li>Educational resources</li>
</ol>

    <h2>The Experience</h2>

<p>From my time spent there, I acquired countless opportunities to learn, fail, and ultimately grow in not just skills, but as a person. There I had hands-on experience:</p> 
    <ul><li>
    Maintaining and directly planting adolescent trees throughout neighborhoods</li></ul>
    <ul><li>
    Using heavy equipment to remove invasive species</li></ul>
    <ul><li>
    Participating in the organization's online marketing sphere to directly reach an audience.</li></ul>

    <h2>The Impact</h2>

<p> While interning there, I had many chances to directly speak to the people who benefited from the work our organization did. Teaching blossoming young scholars while simultaneously interacting with elders who have spent their entire lives in Springfield was an honor I cherish deeply. From my time there I even had the chance to meet many notable figures! Depicted below is one situation with our regarded mayor of Springfield, <a href="https://www.springfield-ma.gov/cos/mayor">Domenic Sarno.</a></p>
