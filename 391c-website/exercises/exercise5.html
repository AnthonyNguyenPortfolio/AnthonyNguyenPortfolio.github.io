        <h1> Getting to know me, Anthony </h1>

        <h2> Concise Bio </h2>
        <p> I'm a born & raised Springfield, MA resident. I grew up experiencing a blast of interconnecting cultures both familiar and foreign in every aspecy of my life. Now I want to translate that into my Illustrations, Animations, and Marketing projects!  </p>

        <p> I deeply respect differing perspectives, feel free to reach out! <a href="mailto:nguyenanthony605@gmail.com">Anytime!</a> </p>

        <h2> Learning More </h2>
        <p> I attended Roger L. Putnam Vocational Technical Academy where I studied the Design & Visual Communications Trade. From there I went to Springfield Technical Community College where I got my associates in Art. Now I'm at the University of Massachusetts Amherst studying Art, Design, & Animation; hoping to double major in Marketing! </p>
        <p> I've had the chance to work a multitude of internships, many of which involved working directly with the community that raised me. I've come a long way since my time as a kid! </p>
